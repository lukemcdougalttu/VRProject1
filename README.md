# VRProject1

This is my project for Virtual Reality CS4431. This is a Web-Based VR. I created my room before and after Covid-19 using Three.js and Aframe. Here are some highlights of the project.

# After Covid19

Since covid19 is a serious virus, I need to make sure my room is clean and Sanitized. 


# Face Mask

There is a face mask that I always put on my dresser to make sure I do not lose it and I keep it next to my keys and wallet so I dont forget.
